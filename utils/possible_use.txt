# In 'vibres.out' see mode "30" has imaginary frequency
# possibly the initial configuration 'geo.txt' is on saddle point
# try pushing the atoms in the configuration toward corresponding direction, showing imaginary freqency, and optimise again!

# Add calculated displacements correspnding to NormalModel #30 with imaginary freqnecy.
